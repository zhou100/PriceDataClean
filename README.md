# Price Data Clean

Project aims to automate some price cleaning and update process with R scripts.

Specifically, I clean and separate raw price data by date, grain type,  transpose themn into the wide format and join with the existing data. 


Scripts are stored in folder "R". For the Malawi price data, the scripts is malawi_price_clean_join.R. 

Raw and cleaned Data are stored in "data/raw" and "data/clean" respectively.
