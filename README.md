# Price Data Clean

Project aims to automate some price cleaning and update process with R scripts.

Specifically, I clean and separate raw price data by date, grain type,  transpose themn into the wide format and join with the existing data. 

To use the code, the easiset way is to click the green "clone or download" button above, and click download zip file; unzip it on your own computer and click on the PriceDataClean.Rproj to start. 

Using the R project feature, all the code and data will be in the right position and you don't need to worry about setting working directory.


Scripts are stored in folder "R". For the Malawi price data, the scripts is malawi_price_clean_join.R. 

Raw and cleaned Data are stored in "data/raw" and "data/clean" respectively.
